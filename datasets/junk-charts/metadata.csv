The title is in all caps and an unusual color, making it hard to read  
Axis labels are too small to be legible  
Y-axis label is vague and doesn't specify units  
X-axis label is too generic and doesn't describe the data properly  
X-ticks don't align with the actual data points, causing confusion  
Line style and marker size are visually overwhelming  
Figure size is too small, making all elements cramped  
Grid lines use a distracting color and style  
Legend placement overlaps with data and reduces readability  
No units are provided for the population or years

The title is overly dramatic and unprofessional
X-tick labels do not match the actual data (countries), making interpretation impossible
Mixed chart types (bar and line) without proper axis separation or context
Y-axis is not labeled with any units or scale, and has ticks removed
Bars and lines are hard to distinguish due to color and overlapping
Figure size is unbalanced and distorts proportions
Legend is positioned far from relevant elements
X-axis label is vague and doesn't describe the data precisely
No clear indication of whether the data is in billions, percentages, etc.
Color choice (cyan and black) is not visually effective for comparison

Figure size is extremely short and wide, making data hard to see
Title is unclear and grammatically incorrect
Y-axis label ""Hotness?"" is informal and ambiguous
X-axis label ""Weekdays!"" is unprofessional and unnecessary
Marker style and size are distracting
Line is too thick for such simple data
Color combination lacks contrast and clarity
Legend is placed where it overlaps with the data
X-axis tick labels are rotated unnecessarily
No units are given for temperature
